# Border Pattern Generator

A configurable pattern generator [inspired by Vera Molnar's plotter drawings.](http://dam.org/artists/phase-one/vera-molnar/artworks-bodies-of-work/works-from-the-1960s-70s) User patterns render as CSS grid elements and can be downloaded as .png file. For this I'm using currently [html2canvas.](http://html2canvas.hertzen.com/)

### Todo before first release:

- [ ] Mobile styles
- [ ] Hide the menu
- [ ] Canvas resize

- [ ] "About" Tab with short info text
- [ ] Proper naming
- [x] Style checkboxes (for major browsers)

### Future releases:

- [ ] More pattern options - more complexity
- [ ] A more dedicated randomize function
- [ ] Pattern export for Illustrator
- [ ] Fix overflow problem
- [ ] Find a better solution than html2canvas, maybe fully switch to canvas?
- [ ] Chrome slider progress style
