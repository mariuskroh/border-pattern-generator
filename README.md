# Border Pattern Generator

A configurable pattern generator [inspired by Vera Molnar's plotter drawings.](http://dam.org/artists/phase-one/vera-molnar/artworks-bodies-of-work/works-from-the-1960s-70s)

- [Early sketch on codepen](https://codepen.io/mariuskroh/pen/povBWEx)
- Users should be able to pick different settings (grid size, randomness, etc...) which result
  in unique patterns.
- Users should be able to download their pattern. For this I'm using [html2canvas.](http://html2canvas.hertzen.com/)
